# Chess Project - Study of AI algorythms

  This study project aims to develop a chess game using AI - neural network - algoritms using JavaScript technology.
  
## Initial version
Tools:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runner
- [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS) library - to avoid manually develop the neural network

Goals:
- Implement chess rules and game play.
- Implement NPC capable of simulation another human player using neural networks.

Results:

Observations:
For now, no benchmarks or source inspirations.
